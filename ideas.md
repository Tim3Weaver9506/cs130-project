# Idea One
## Bob Ross Elements by Episode
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/bob-ross/elements-by-episode.csv

How many Episodes of Bob Ross contain a certain theme?

To answer this question, I could use the str.count function with the certain theme inside the file to find out how many episodes include said theme.

How does the data account for outliers?

# Idea Two
## Classic Rock
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/classic-rock/classic-rock-song-list.csv

What types of rock and roll are they considering within the data?

How does the data perform under an algorithm?
