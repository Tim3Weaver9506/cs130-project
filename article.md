## The Joy of Coding (Not Really) 

The process I have gone through to make my code was a bit challenging, I feel like I knew what I wanted to do, but didn't know how to go about it. Sort of like a writers block, I was a bit stumped with how to take things. At first, I wanted to try using str.count but that was before I understood lists and dictionaries, also im fairly sure that wouldn't have worked since the cleaned file is appendeed to a list. So instead, I decided I wanted to make a dictionary with the episodes as the index and the elements being grouped with what episode they appeared first, since it would make the next few parts easier.
