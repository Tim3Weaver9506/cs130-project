# Processing the Information

## The Joy of Coding (Not Really) 

The process I have gone through to make my code was a bit challenging, I feel like I knew what I wanted to do, but didn't know how to go about it. Sort of like a writers block, I was a bit stumped with how to take things. At first, I wanted to try using str.count but that was before I understood lists and dictionaries, also im fairly sure that wouldn't have worked since the cleaned file is appendeed to a list. So instead, I decided I wanted to make a dictionary with the episodes as the index and the elements being grouped with what episode they appeared first, since it would make the next few parts easier. 

### Figure 1: Frequency of Elements in Bob Ross Episodes

<From this data, I found that Trees in general were the most prevelant element in Bob Ross: The Joy of Painting. As you can see, it accounts for around 86% of all the episodes. Many of Bob Ross paintings were obviously landscape paintings so elements such as 'BUILDINGS' or 'BRIDGES' are not featured as much in his paintings>

### Figure 2: Frequency of Colors in Bob Ross Episodes

<This data set was more of a addition to my original plan, This showcases the frequency of colors used in the episodes of Bob Ross: The Joy Of Painting. He notably uses Titanium_White the most, this is because he was very fond of winter landscapes. Strangly enough, he does not use Indian_Red at all, despite it being included. I did a bit of research and found out he reflected the color of Indian_red by using a mix of different reds.>
